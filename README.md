# Mood.fm: Dynamic Mood-based Playlist Generator

This project aims to develop an innovative machine learning-based system that recommends song playlists tailored to user preferences, listening history, and emotional states. Using the Moodify Kaggle Dataset, which contains over 278,000 emotion-labeled songs from Spotify, we will construct a system that not only recommends songs based on past listening behavior but also adapts to user-input preferences regarding desired emotions or moods. By leveraging advanced techniques in recommender systems and mood-based music classification, this project will contribute to the ongoing research on personalized music recommendations. Our project is innovative in several ways:

- It combines traditional collaborative filtering with mood-based recommendations.
- It incorporates short-term (7-day) listening trends to capture recent preferences.
- It allows for explicit mood-based input from users, enhancing personalization.
